    <h4>Why is Valorant so popular?</h4>
    <p>Most of Valorant's success can be attributed to its unique story, gameplay, and characters, and the creators continue to capitalize on these features. 
        Furthermore, Valorant features a diverse set of playable agents and maps from all over the world, which speaks to its global player base.
        Below we could see a geographical distribution of the agents and maps within the game. Hint: Try hovering over each point for more info!</p>
